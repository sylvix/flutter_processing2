# `ellipse()`

```dart
void ellipse(num a, num b, num c, num d)
```

Draws an ellipse (oval) to the screen. An ellipse with equal width and height is a circle. By default, the first two parameters set the location, and the third and fourth parameters set the shape's width and height. The origin may be changed with the `ellipseMode()` function.
